Bulls and Cows Game
-------------
Installation:

You do not need to install it, it will be hosted by some service :)

Rules:
--------------
One player, the Chooser (bot in our case), thinks of a four-letter number and the other player, the Guesser, tries to guess it.

At each turn the Guesser tries a four-letter number, and the Chooser says how close it is to the answer by giving:

The number of Bulls - digits correct in the right position.
The number of Cows - digits correct but in the wrong position.

The Guesser tries to guess the answer in the fewest number of turns.
